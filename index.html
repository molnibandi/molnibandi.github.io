            Java Back-end Developer
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am 43 years old, I live in Budapest. I have over 20 years experience in hotel business. Due to Covid
            pandemic, the sector suffered a major crisis, so I needed to find or start another profession.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have loved computers, since I was six years old. I got my first PC, a ZX Spectrum. I have learned Basic
            programming language on my own from magazines. I found a code, I typed it in to see what happens. I tried to
            make some changes to see the affects.
